# Double Bass Database 

Double Bass Database is a resource for bassists to explore bass music avaiable to perform. Double bass music is a niche area of music publication, and as a result, it can be difficult to find music to perform. Double Bass Database seeks to solve this issue by providing bassists with an open-source list of bass music to browse. Users can login, see the complete list, and favorite pieces that are populated in an individual users favorites list.
